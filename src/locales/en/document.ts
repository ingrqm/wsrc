        communicationDevice: `During the speed reading event, the participant is not allowed to use any communication device (mobile phone, talky walky,...) or communication application or software (whatsapp, messenger, Facebook,...) except those provided for the competition. The use of any of these means of communication will be considered as an attempt at fraud and will result in the automatic disqualification of the candidate.`,
        communicatePhysically: `During the speed reading test, it is strictly forbidden to communicate physically with another person. In the event of communication with another person (outside the APAC staff), the candidate will be disqualified.`,
        allowNote: `During the reading of the book, the participant is allowed to take notes only on blank sheets of paper before the test.`,
        referToNote: `The participant may refer to his or her note-taking to answer questions after the reading of the book has been completed.`,
        readingAids: `The participant is allowed to use his/her own reading aids, such as visual guides or other aids. Such a tool must not contain electronics or a memory or recording system, neither visual nor audio. The use of abnormal tools will result in the disqualification of the participant.`,
        makeNoise: 'It is strictly forbidden for the participant to make noise during the reading event.',
        camera: `It is forbidden for the participant to disappear from the camera during the event, even to go to the toilet. The participant must make all arrangements before the event. In case of disappearance from the camera field, the contestant will be disqualified immediately.`,
        access: `After validating the registration, the candidate will access an online reading area where he/she will do the speed reading test.`,
        timeToRead: `The maximum time to read the book is 2 hours. Each participant is timed. As soon as the candidate has finished reading, he/she must click on the "finish reading" button. The reading time is recorded, the book is automatically taken away and the comprehension questionnaire with 20 questions is taken. The participant then has a maximum of 30 minutes to answer the questions.`,
        onlyOneDevice: `The participant can only connect to the reading platform from one device (computer, tablet, etc.).

This connection to Zoom can be made from another device different from the one used to read the book. This other device must be equipped with a camera.`,
        internet: `An internet connection is required to participate in the competition.
